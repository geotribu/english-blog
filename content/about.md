# What is Geotribu?

![Geotribu logo](https://cdn.geotribu.fr/img/internal/charte/geotribu_logo_75x75.webp "Geotribu logo"){: .img-thumbnail-left }

From a strictly formal point of view, Geotribu is a [domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name). And three suffixes (.fr, .net, and .org, while the [.com has long been squatted](https://www.whois.com/whois/geotribu.com) waiting for us to become [rich](https://www.networksolutions.com/products/domain/domain-search-results)).  
There is no structure: neither entrepreneurial, nor associative, nor a blood pact in a tipi. In fact, the agreement for loaning the server used to [host images](https://contribuer.geotribu.fr/guides/cdn-images-hebergement/) from [GeoRezo] is in Julien’s name, and the [domain is owned by Fabien](https://www.whois.com/whois/geotribu.net).

It’s a spontaneous gathering of people around a shared professional interest: the geographic aspect of each person’s profession. Then comes the "editorial" line, set from the beginning, which I present as two sides of the same coin:

- on one side, the technical aspect: IT labels us as "geo-geeks," convinced that mastering tools serves thematic work, while keeping in mind that tools are the means, not the end.

- on the other side, openness: a philosophy naturally aligned with the sharing approach inherent to the site (have you noticed the [copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft) symbol at the footer?). Beyond our own belief that open-source, open access, and the commons are virtuous levers, it doesn’t mean we never use proprietary software or look down on it; rather, we believe that proprietary vendors usually have the means to do their own advertising.
