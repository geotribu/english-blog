# Presentation and feedback from the QGIS-fr User Conference in Avignon

Mid-June, [the French-speaking QGIS User Conference](https://conf.qgis.osgeo.fr/) was held in Avignon, Southern France - a city often described as "_the City of the Popes_", thanks to the Popes' Palace, the city's number one attraction. Not far from the non-terminated bridge, which has inspired some happy songs around the world.

The french-speaking QGIS community could meet, discuss and share some insightful ideas and moments together. The conference brought over 280 people from the 6 corners of France including _Antilles_, as well as Belgium, Togo, Switzerland. The QGIS-fr User Conference, using the **#QGISFR2025** hashtag on social media, proposed events during 3 days :

- during day 1, participants were able to take part to the 20 proposed workshops, on a variety of balanced QGIS topics. Approximately 200 people attended to that day. On the evening was also organized a shared aperitif and dinner.
- day 2 was the conference day, with no less than 12 insightful talks, which showcased interesting usages and strategies around QGIS for the 220 attendants.
- day 3 was devoted to contributions to the QGIS project, focusing on 5 axis : development, funding, documentation, translation and communication. Approximately 75 people attended to that day.

The QGIS-fr User Conference is organized by [OSGeo-fr](https://www.osgeo.fr/), the french local chapter of the OSGeo Foundation. This year's edition was in partnership and co-organized with [Avignon Universit√©](https://univ-avignon.fr/), and especially the [UMR 7300 ESPACE](https://www.umrespace.org/en/presentation-en/) Unit.

The money raised by participants and sponsors registrations will be used to finance the QGIS project, as well as other projects on which QGIS depends.

We're already looking forward to next year : the next edition will be held in March, in Brest - Brittany region, a place often described as "_the End of the World_". The 2026 QGIS-fr User Conference will be organized in collaboration with [the UMR LETG](https://letg.cnrs.fr/) Unit.
