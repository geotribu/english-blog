# Presentation and feedback from the QGIS-fr Users Meeting in Avignon

Mid-June, [the French-speaking QGIS Users Meeting](https://conf.qgis.osgeo.fr/) was held in Avignon, Southern France - a city often described as "_the City of the Popes_", thanks to the Popes' Palace, the city's number one attraction. Not far from the non-terminated bridge, which has inspired some happy songs around the world as well as the 2025 edition banner :

The french-speaking QGIS community could meet, discuss and share some insightful ideas and moments together. The conference brought over 280 people from the 6 corners of France including _Guadeloupe_, as well as Belgium, Togo, Switzerland. The QGIS-fr Users Meeting, using the _#QGISFR2025_ hashtag on social media, proposed events during 3 days :

- during day 1, participants were able to take part to the 20 proposed workshops, on a variety of balanced QGIS topics. Approximately 200 people attended to that day. On the evening was also organized a shared aperitif and dinner.
